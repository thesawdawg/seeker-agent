This is the core mandatory output — generated for every pipeline run regardless of what the researcher requested.
Its purpose is NOT to summarise the findings. Its purpose is to actively guide the researcher through the intellectual territory so they can achieve genuine comprehension, not just awareness.

Format: Markdown (.md)
Audience: The researcher conducting this investigation — someone who has run this pipeline and now needs to deeply understand the field before proposing their own contribution.

---

CITATION REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):

You will be given a CITABLE SOURCES MANIFEST at the end of the context. Each entry has a short citation key in square brackets, e.g. `[Freire1970]` or `[Nabulsi2009]`.

Every substantive assertion in your Understanding Map — every claim about the field's history, its debates, its foundational works, its unresolved questions — must end with one or more `[CiteKey]` markers drawn from the manifest. The citation marks which source from the pipeline's retrieval supports the claim.

Rules:
- Use ONLY cite keys that appear in the manifest. Do not invent keys.
- Do not cite a source you could not plausibly defend as supporting the claim.
- If a claim has no supporting source in the manifest, either drop the claim or mark it explicitly with `[no source in run]` and rephrase it as an open question.
- Place citations at the end of the sentence or clause they support, in square brackets: `...the field divided over the question of intentionality [Nabulsi2009, Wind2024].`
- In the Reading Curriculum (section 3), each listed work MUST use its manifest cite key in the title line, formatted as: `**[CiteKey]** Title — Author, Year`.
- Do NOT add a References section yourself — one will be appended automatically after your output.

---

STRUCTURE (follow this exactly):

## 0. Coverage and Confidence
A short preamble (80-120 words) that tells the researcher what the map is built on, so they can calibrate their trust. Use the COVERAGE MATRIX block provided in the context. State:
  - The total number of sources the map is built from, and how they break down by source (e.g. OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar) and by type (current / seminal / historical).
  - How many distinct themes the sources cover.
  - Any themes flagged as THIN-COVERAGE (fewer than 3 sources). Explicitly warn the researcher that claims about those themes rest on limited evidence and should be treated as provisional.
  - If the COVERAGE MATRIX shows PREVIOUSLY SEEN sources, note how many sources are new vs previously seen from a prior run.
  - One sentence on what this means for how to read the rest of the map (e.g. "The foundations are well-supported; the current frontier is thinner and several of its claims are best read as hypotheses to test").
Do NOT cite individual sources in this section — it is a meta-statement about coverage, not a claim about content.

## 1. The Territory at a Glance
A single dense paragraph (150-200 words) that frames the intellectual landscape. Not a summary — a map legend. What are the 2-3 central tensions that organise this entire field? What is the one question that, if answered, would unlock everything else? What kind of field is this — one with empirical consensus but conceptual confusion, or one with competing frameworks and no shared method?

## 2. The Intellectual Genealogy — How We Got Here
A narrative (300-400 words) tracing the intellectual lineage from foundational ideas to the present. Written as a story of ideas, not a list of papers. Show causality: who was responding to whom, what broke what framework, what vindicated what dismissed approach. The researcher must feel the trajectory, not just know the milestones.

## 3. The Reading Curriculum
Organise the seminal works into THREE tiers. For each work:
  - **[CiteKey]** Title — Author, Year
  - Why you read it at this tier (not what it says — why the ORDER matters)
  - What to look for while reading (2-3 specific active reading prompts)
  - What it connects to (which other works it responds to or anticipates, by cite key)

**Tier 1 — Foundations (read first):** Works that establish the basic vocabulary and frame the problem. Without these, later works are opaque.

**Tier 2 — The Main Debates (read second):** Works where the central tensions crystallised. These are the works where the field divided — understanding each position here is essential before engaging with current literature.

**Tier 3 — The Current Frontier (read third):** Recent work that represents where the field is now. Read these AFTER the foundations — their significance is only visible against the historical background.

## 4. The Conceptual Map — How the Ideas Connect
A structured prose section (250-350 words) describing the relationships between key concepts, NOT between papers. Which concepts are contested? Which definitions are doing hidden theoretical work? Where does an apparent consensus actually rest on an unresolved disagreement one level deeper? This section should be readable as a standalone guide to the intellectual architecture. Cite sources at claim level.

## 5. The Unresolved Core
Identify the single most important unresolved question in the field — the one that the pipeline found unanswered and that the researcher's own work could engage with. Explain:
  - Why this question remains open (is it empirically underdetermined? philosophically contested? methodologically blocked?) — with citations for prior positions
  - What a genuine contribution to this question would require
  - What distinguishes a superficial engagement with this question from a deep one

## 6. Self-Assessment Questions — Test Your Understanding
Generate exactly 8 questions. These are NOT factual recall questions. They are Socratic questions that test whether the researcher has understood the STRUCTURE of the field — the tensions, the assumptions, the logical dependencies.

For each question:
  - State the question clearly
  - Provide the answer (2-4 sentences), with citations to manifest sources
  - Explain why this question matters for the researcher's own work

Questions should test:
  - Whether the researcher understands WHY a debate is unresolvable (not just what the positions are)
  - Whether the researcher can identify hidden assumptions in dominant frameworks
  - Whether the researcher understands what a genuine contribution would require
  - Whether the researcher can distinguish empirical gaps from conceptual ones
  - Whether the researcher understands the historical reasons why certain approaches were abandoned

---

RULES:
- Every reading recommendation must come from the manifest — do not invent sources
- The active reading prompts must be specific to each work — not generic "take notes as you read"
- The assessment questions must have correct, substantive answers grounded in the pipeline outputs
- Do not summarise the pipeline outputs — transform them into intellectual guidance
- The tone is that of a rigorous academic supervisor preparing a graduate student for their first major reading
- Every substantive claim must carry a `[CiteKey]` drawn from the manifest
