# Contributing to SEEKER

Thank you for your interest in contributing. SEEKER is an open research tool and welcomes contributions from researchers, developers, and anyone interested in improving academic research workflows.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Install the dependencies, including the test extras.** The suite needs
   `pytest` and `httpx`, and several modules degrade to opaque failures when
   an optional dependency is half-installed — a broken `cryptography` shows
   up as dozens of `RuntimeError: This portal is not running`, which says
   nothing about the real cause. Install everything:

   ```bash
   pip install -e '.[dev,web,mysql]'
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the rest of the environment** (see README.md)
4. **Run the tests** to make sure everything works:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pytest -q
   ```

   You should see all tests pass, with the MySQL suite skipped unless a
   server is configured. If you get a wall of errors instead, check the
   install above before looking at the code.

## What Can You Contribute?

### New Source Handlers

The easiest way to contribute. Each source handler in `agents/social.py` follows a simple pattern:

```python
class YourSourceHandler(SourceHandler):
    SOURCE_ID = "your_source"
    
    def search(self, query, keywords, limit=10, run_id=""):
        # Call your API
        # Return list of dicts with: title, authors, year, abstract, doi, etc.
        return results
```

Add your handler to `SOURCE_HANDLERS` dict and add the source to `config.json` themes.

### New Concept Map Clusters

If SEEKER doesn't recognize your research domain, add a cluster to `concept_map.json`:

```json
{
  "cluster_id": "your_domain",
  "label": "Your Research Domain",
  "trigger_concepts": ["term1", "term2", "term3"],
  "disciplines": ["political_science", "sociology"],
  "bridge_concepts": ["connecting_idea_1"]
}
```

Then add the discipline → theme_id mapping in `core/concept_mapper.py`'s `EXPLICIT_MAP`.

### New Themes

Add themes to `config.json` with keywords and source lists:

```json
{
  "theme_id": "your_theme",
  "label": "Your Theme Label",
  "keywords": [{"seed": "keyword1"}, {"seed": "keyword2"}],
  "sources": ["openalex", "semantic_scholar"]
}
```

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Run the test suite before and after your changes
- Keep the argument tree as the single source of truth
- Every claim must be traceable to an evidence node with a real source

## Code Style

- Python 3.11+
- No strict formatter enforced — match the existing style
- Docstrings on all public functions
- Type hints encouraged but not required
- JSON output from agents must be parseable — always include fallback parsing

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest -q

# Run one module
python3 -m pytest tests/test_pipeline_state.py -v

# Test a source handler against the live API
python3 main.py test --source openalex --query "neural networks"
```

CI runs the suite on Python 3.11 and 3.12, against both SQLite and MySQL,
and builds the Docker image (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`).

### A note on threads

Per-run state — the run binding, the credential owner, the live step — is
carried in `contextvars`. A new thread starts with an **empty** context, so
anything handed to a `threading.Thread` or a `ThreadPoolExecutor` must be
wrapped with `core.runctx.run_in_thread` or `core.runctx.propagate`. Nothing
raises if you forget: the run silently falls back to config.json credentials
and env-var keys.

If you add threaded work, add a test that asserts **from inside the worker
thread**. A same-thread assertion passes either way, which is how this class
of bug last shipped.
